# ls 

ls is probably the most common command. A lot of times, you’ll be working in a directory and you’ll need to know what files are located there. The ls command allows you to quickly view all files within the specified directory.

# touch 
is going to be the easiest way to create new files, but it can also be used to change timestamps on files and/or directories. You can create as many files as you want in a single command without worrying about overwriting files with the same name.

# mkdir  Create a directory

mkdir is a useful command you can use to create directories. Any number of directories can be created simultaneously which can greatly speed up the process.

# pwd 

 Print working directory

# rmdir 

will remove empty directories. This can help clean up space on your computer and keep files and folders organized.
